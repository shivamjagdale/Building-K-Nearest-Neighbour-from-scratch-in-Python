Building K-Nearest Neighbour from scratch in Python

Here we are building k nearest neighbours from scratch in python.
We will give the user to choose from which distance he wants to use to calcualte the distance between the test-data and other datapoints

Then we need to sort the distance values from min to max
And then we can recommend the datapoints to our user. The user will manually enter the value for K.
